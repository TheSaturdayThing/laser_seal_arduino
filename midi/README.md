The Laser Seal uses an Arduino to contol a [SparkFun MP3 Player Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-mp3-player-shield.html).  
This board utilizes the VS1053B MP3 audio decoder IC to decode audio files

The [Arduino vs1053 Library](https://github.com/mpflaga/Arduino_Library-vs1053_for_SdFat) explains how the board is set up.

Original driver files can be found on [Github](https://github.com/mpflaga/Arduino_Library-vs1053_for_SdFat)
